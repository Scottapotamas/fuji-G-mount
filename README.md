# Fujifilm G Mount
My long-term photography/hobby goals are rather ambitious; build a film camera from scratch using modern lenses.



At time of writing, no publicly available information about the mount's mechanics could be found other than the flange distance and internal diameter. Similarly, any electrical interface or protocol information is out of the public domain.



## Aims

- Document the Fujifilm G Mount lens
