# GF Mount Electrical Notes

# Basics

The electrical connections between the body and lens are made with 12 spring loaded contacts (body) which mechanically align with 11 contact rectangles (lens).

## Body Side

- Spring-loaded pins are on the body side, flat pads are on the lens side.
- The spring section of the pins have a 1.0 mm diameter, and a maximum achievable travel of 0.8mm.
- The spring pins have a conical/round tip.
- The pins are gold.
- The pins are spaced 6째 apart, for a total span/range of 66째. There is no pin on the vertical from the mount center-point, the outermost edge pins are aligned at +33째 and -33째 from the vertical datum.
- The mount (metal ring/bayonet assembly) is electrically common with the exposed metal inside the battery compartment, and `Pin 5` and `Pin 6`.

## Lens Side

- The lens-side contacts are 1.6 x 1.3 mm rectangular pads, with the long edge aligned tangentially to the circular mount.

- When looking at the back of the lens mount, the right-most pin is a 1.3 mm x 1.3 mm square contact.

- For ease of convention, I'll label this square pad as `Pin 1`, though I don't know what the official Fuji nomenclature is.

- Based on this numbering scheme, `Pin 5` and `Pin 6` are mechanically the same contact rectangle, and therefore electrically common.

- Unlike the body side mount, the lens mount/bayonet is not electrically common with `Pin 5` and `Pin 6`.

  

# Experiments with the MCEX-45G

Extension tube provides probable contacts for both sides of the mount.

Is the extension tube 'passive' or active?

- Camera doesn't seem to distinguish or behave differently with tube attached.

- Electrical connections appear to be direct connections - measurements below show measurement error.
